              I recently left education to pursue a career in software
              engineering. As a recipient of the 2022 Edie Windsor Scholarship
              through Lesbians Who Tech, I am currently attending The Grace
              Hopper Program @ Fullstack Academy with a graduation date of
              September 2022.
              <br />
              <br />
              My aim as a software engineer is to help users reach their ideas
              by creating web tools that are useful and streamlined--all while
              being responsive to the heightened demands placed on creators,
              workers, and learners as a result of the pandemic.

              Software Engineering relies heavily on continual learning as well
              as collaborating with other engineers. Being able to know your
              audience and be able to teach other engineers is a skill that
              requires patience and a deep understanding of how learning
              happens. My experience as a former educator translate well to
              engineering in regards to my own continual learning and fostering
              growth in the members of my team.
