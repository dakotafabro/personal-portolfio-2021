              through Lesbians Who Tech, I have progressed from Education to
              Software Engineering. I am a graduate of The Grace Hopper Program
              @ Fullstack Academy in New York, NY.
              <br />
              <br />
              My aim as a software engineer is to help users reach their ideas
              by creating web tools that are useful and streamlined--all while
              being responsive to the heightened demands placed on creators,
              workers, and learners as a result of the pandemic.
              <br />
              <br />
              I specialize in the PERN and FERN tech stacks, but am dedicated to
              learning new technology as curiosity drives me.

              Software Engineering relies heavily on continual learning as well
              as collaborating with other engineers. Being able to know your
              audience and teach other engineers is a skill that requires
              patience and a deep understanding of how learning happens. My
              experience as a former educator translates well to engineering in
              regards to my own continual learning and fostering growth in the
              members of any teams on which I may find myself.
