              through Lesbians Who Tech, I have progressed from Education to
              Software Engineering. I am a graduate of The Grace Hopper Program
              @ Fullstack Academy in New York, NY.
              <br />
              <br />
              My aim as a software engineer is to help users reach their ideas
              by creating web tools that are useful and streamlined--all while
              being responsive to the heightened demands placed on creators,
              workers, and learners as a result of the pandemic.
              <br />
              <br />
              I specialize in the PERN and FERN tech stacks, but am dedicated to
              learning new technology as curiosity drives me.
