              through Lesbians Who Tech, I have progressed from Education to
              Software Engineering. I am a graduate of The Grace Hopper Program
              @ Fullstack Academy in New York, NY.

              My aim as a software engineer is to help users reach their ideas
              by creating web tools that are useful and streamlined--all while
              being responsive to the heightened demands placed on creators,
              workers, and learners as a result of the pandemic.

              Software Engineering relies heavily on continual learning as well
              as collaborating with other engineers. Being able to know your
              audience and teach other engineers is a skill that requires
              patience and a deep understanding of how learning happens. My
              experience as a former educator translates well to engineering in
              regards to my own continual learning and fostering growth in the
              members of any teams on which I may find myself.
