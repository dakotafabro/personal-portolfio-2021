In just months, I now have the skills needed to create responsive web-based applications and seek to apply these skills to effectively improve classroom instruction.",

              As a Google Certified Educator, former classroom teacher, and

              My aim as a front-end web developer is to help users reach their
              full potential by creating web tools that are useful and
              streamlined--all while being responsive to the heightened demands
              placed on creators, workers, and learners as a result of the
              pandemic.

              As a Google Certified Educator, I was able to design engaging
              learning curriculum in order to teach students 21st century
              technology skills. By doing so, students were empowered to see the
              internet and current technology as a tool for innovation rather
              than a place to consume and play. Students were able to broaden
              their worldviews while taking ownership of their own learning.
