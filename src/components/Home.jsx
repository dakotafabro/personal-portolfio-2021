They want to be engaged, challenged, and have fun--without the hassle of user interface confusion. As the landscape of education evolves, so too should our tech.",

I then took the initiative to teach myself how to code in order to move toward being able to be on the other side of the learning tools being used in the classroom. In just months, I now have the skills needed to create responsive web-based applications and seek to apply these skills to effectively improve classroom instruction.",
