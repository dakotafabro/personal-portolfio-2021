              As a Google Certified Educator, I understand the importance of
              creating web apps that are engaging, intuitive, and useful for
              assessing student growth.
              <br />
              <br />
              My aim as a front-end developer is to help educators and students
              reach their full potential within the classroom--all while being
              responsive to the heightened demands placed on classroom educators
              during the current pandemic.
